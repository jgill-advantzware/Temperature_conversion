Before you start:
1. Create a user in iam with programatic access to create key pairs  -- which will be used while configuring code build plugin

2. To create your key pair for EC2 instances follow below steps.
Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
In the navigation pane, under NETWORK & SECURITY, choose Key Pairs.
Choose Create key pair.
For Name, enter a descriptive name for the key pair. Amazon EC2 associates the public key with the name that you specify as the key name. A key name can include up to 255 ASCII characters. It canâ€™t include leading or trailing spaces.
For File format, choose the format in which to save the private key. To save the private key in a format that can be used with OpenSSH, choose pem. To save the private key in a format that can be used with PuTTY, choose ppk.
Choose Create key pair.
The private key file is automatically downloaded by your browser. The base file name is the name you specified as the name of your key pair, and the file name extension is determined by the file format you chose. Save the private key file in a safe place.

3. Create VPC Id and two subnets in the same VPC. This is required for Step 2 during input to cloud formation. 

4. Go to your repository in Github --> Settings --> Webhooks and configure the webhook according to 
image 10. Make sure the URL you enter is http://<IP ADDRESS OF JENKINS EC2 SERVER>/github-webhook/
